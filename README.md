Secure traffic flowing in and out of your WordPress site at its extremity.

## Getting Started

```shell
nvm use && make
```

When developing with WordPress, you might need to help your IDE by downloading a copy of WordPress.

```shell
make help_ide
```

## Verification

### Linting

-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
-   [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)

```shell
make lint
```

These rules can then be automatically applied:

```shell
make format
```

### Unit Testing

-   [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)

```shell
make test
```

Executes unit tests contained within the `test/unit/php` directory.

### Integration Testing

> ⚠️ Currently only for manual testing.

```shell
make local
```

You can then access a live instance of WordPress with extremity plugin
installed [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Design

### Concepts

#### Response Modification

Content generated by WordPress is modified to apply security best practices, such as the addition of a Content Security
Policy.

#### Suspicious Behaviour Reporting

On detection of behaviour that is considered to be potentially suspicious, a report is generated and delivered to the
configured reporting provider.

#### Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

WP-JSON endpoints that allow listing of user PII are disabled, along with automatically generated sitemap entries.

### Tech Stack

-   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktopm)
-   [PHP (v7.4)](https://www.php.net) - This version will match
    the [minimum requirements for WordPress](https://en-au.wordpress.org/about/requirements/).
-   [WordPress (v6.0)](https://wordpress.org/)

### Coding Standards
